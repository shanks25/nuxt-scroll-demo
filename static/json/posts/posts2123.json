She was an extremely hard worker and the sole wage earner for her family. She would pull 12 hour shifts 6 days a week. She recently started doing chemo for breast cancer while maintaining that level of work. She was Clearly not doing well. Me and my coworkers tried to donate some of our PTO to her so that she could just go do her chemo and not have to worry about money. Corporate told us that this is not allowed. They dragged their feet on approving her medical leave and she ended up working several weeks WHILE DOING CHEMOTHERAPY. By the last shift that she worked she could barely walk and had trouble speaking AND STILL WORKED A 13 HOUR SHIFT. We recently heard from her family that she passed away due to complications from chemotherapy. I am really sickened by this situation. I cannot say for sure that she would have survived if she didn't feel like she had had to work but corporate should have immediately approved her medical leave so that she could have just focused on her treatment.
