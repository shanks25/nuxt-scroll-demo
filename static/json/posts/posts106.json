President Assad ( who is bad ) is a nasty guy who got so nasty his people rebelled and the Rebels ( who are good ) started winning ( Hurrah). But then some of the rebels turned a bit nasty and are now called Islamic State ( who are definitely bad) and some continued to support democracy ( who are still good.) So the Americans ( who are questionably good ) started bombing Islamic State ( who are bad ) and giving arms to the Syrian Rebels ( who are good ) so they could fight Assad ( who is still bad ) which was good. By the way there is a breakaway state in the north run by the Kurds who want to fight IS ( which is a good thing ) but the Turkish authorities think they are bad so we have to say they are bad whilst secretly thinking they're good and giving them guns to fight IS (which is good) but that is another matter. Reply  WH ce ellaaaa93j 933 Points 1d @ellaaaa93j So a Coalition of Assad ( still bad ) Putin (extra bad ) and the Iranians ( good but in a bad sort of way ) are going to attack IS ( who are bad ) which is a good thing but also the Syrian Rebels ( who are good ) which is bad. Now the British ( obviously good except that nice Mr Corbyn in the corduroy jacket who is probably bad ) and the Americans ( also good ) cannot attack Assad ( still bad ) for fear of upsetting Putin ( bad ) and Iran ( good  bad) and now they have to accept that Assad might not be that bad after all compared to IS ( who are super bad). So Assad ( bad ) is now probably good being better than IS ( but lets face it drinking your own wee is better than IS so no real choice there ) and since Putin and Iran are also fighting IS that may now make them Good. CC i A ellaaaa93j 676 Points 1d @ellaaaa93j America ( still Good ) will find it hard to arm a group of rebels being attacked by the Russians for fear of upsetting Mr Putin ( now good ) and that nice mad Ayatollah in Iran ( also Good ) and so they may be forced to say that the Rebels are now Bad or at the very least abandon them to their fate. This will lead most of them to flee to Turkey and on to Europe or join IS ( still the only constantly bad group). To Sunni Muslims an attack by Shia Muslims (Assad and Iran ) backed by Russians will be seen as something of a Holy War and the ranks of IS will now be seen by the Sunnis as the only Jihadis fighting in the Holy War and hence many Muslims will now see IS as Good ( Doh.)
