HIS ANSWER IS GENIUS. You are driving along in your car on a wild stormy night. You pass by a bus stop, and you see three people waiting for the bus : 1. An old lady who looks as if she is about to die. 2. An old friend who once saved your life. 3. The perfect man (or) woman you have been dreaming about. Which one would you choose to offer a ride to knowing that there could only be one passenger in your car. Think before you continue reading. This is a moral\/ethical dilemma that was once actually used as part of a job application. You could pick up the old lady because she is going to die and thus you should save her first or you could take the old friend because he once saved your life and this would be the perfect chance to pay him back. However you may never be able to find your perfect dream lover again. The candidate who was hired (Out of 200 applicants) had no trouble coming up with his answer. I love this I may actually use it sometime for an interview situation. WHAT DID HE SAY He simply answered \"I would give the car keys to my old friend and let him take the lady to the hospital. I would stay behind and wait for the bus with the woman of my dreams.\" Never forget to \"Think Outside of the Box.\" Memes.","page_title":"THIS MAN WAS GIVEN A MORAL DILEMMA AT HIS JOB INTERVIEW.
