Posted On 8072006 1244pm The voice of the joker is by far his best role and the one he was born to play. The cartoon joker (in batman and justice league) are far far more accurate (even if they are a bit less homicidal than they should be) than the movies have been Ledger just doesn't have what it takes. Please... No. The Joker is a character that needs an actor with gravity. Not some little twerp who got lucky. MAYBE WE CAN GIVE ROBERT PATTINSON A CHANCE AS BATMAN.
