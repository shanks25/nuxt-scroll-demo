Stop with this stupidity. Every week some idiot writes an article just trying to make DC look bad $30000 is the pay BEFORE the film is released. $14 million is the total pay AFTER THE film has been released due to bonuses. She will get paid more later. I love when movies pay like this. Never forget that this is how Keanu Reeves fucked over Warner bros and became the highest paid actor of all time. All because he was willing to take a much lower pay upfront pay in exchange for a higher cut of the overall profits and they agreed thinking the movie wouldn't be that successful. So instead of the $10 million they originally offered him he ended up being paid $256 million dollars for the matrix in its first year and is still getting paid around $5 million for it every single year. 18 years later..
