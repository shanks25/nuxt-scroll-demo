She had caught the train in from Frankston. And while she was waiting for the train to come she noticed a man sitting down on the platform with a bag of fish and chips. But he wasnt really eating them. He was just sort of letting them air. This attracted a few seagulls who began to circle the platform. Instead of shooing the birds away the man offered them a few chips. Hed toss one a foot or so away from him. It was like he was beckoning them to come closer. He kept doing this eking the chips out slowly until there was a big group of seagulls in front of him 15 or 20. A tiny army. Hed throw them a chip every now and then - just enough to keep the birds interested but not enough to sate them. It was frustrating. They were getting angry. Squawking. It was like he was rearing them up for... something. Then the train came and everyone got on. But the man stayed on the ground with his chips. Just when the train was about to leave. It happened. Right before the doors closed the man threw the entire bag of the fish and chips into the train. The entire flock of seagulls followed the bag. And the doors closed. Inside the train pandemonium. The next train stop was five minutes away. Memes.","page_title":"Guys this is the true crime story of the decade Yesterday a friend told me what might well be the best story I've ever heard.
