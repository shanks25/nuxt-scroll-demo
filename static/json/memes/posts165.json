Like - Reply -1w OFo\" Be The Match  Hi there We encourage everyone to join the registry though there is a critical need for those with diverse ethnic backgrounds to join. When it comes to matching human leukocyte antigen (HLA) types a patient's ethnic background is important in predicting the likelihood of finding a match. This is because HLA markers used in matching are inherited. Some ethnic groups have more complex tissue types than others. So a person's best chance of finding a donor may be with someone of the same ethnic background. If you are not yet on the registry you can join online by clicking here httpms.spr.ly6187r7L3J. We hope you advocate for others to join the registry and give hope to searching patients.
