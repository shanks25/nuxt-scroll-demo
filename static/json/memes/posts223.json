Heath The Joker Bad casting. Bad joke. \nprobably the worst casting of all time \ngood job guys shoulda cast Crispin Glover as he was you know born to play the part \n Heath Ledger Really I mean really now \nposted by JBean22 Health Ledger A joker I dont think so \nI am NOT seeing this movie if he is in it. Join Date Jul 2005 Location NYC There are over a million better choices they could have picked Posts 1220 someone off the street at random and made a better choice. Points 8373 T understand why they wouldn't have nicholson again (he stole the show Achievements last time but IMO the joker does that in every appearance he makes in @ the comics) I think the really appropriate choice would be mark hamill. Posted On 8072006 1244pm The voice of the joker is by far his best role and the one he was born to play. The cartoon joker (in batman and justice league) are far far more accurate (even if they are a bit less homicidal than they should be) than the movies have been Ledger just doesn't have what it takes. Please... No. The Joker is a character that needs an actor with gravity. Not some little twerp who got lucky.  \n\nMAYBE WE CAN GIVE ROBERT PATTINSON A CHANCE AS BATMAN","title":"Remove Twilight from his filmography and hes done some incredible work","slug":"remove-twilight-from-his-filmography-and-hes-done-some-incredible-work","tags":[],"tag_list":null,"categories":"No Category"},{"id":27152,"image":"https:\/\/celestialmemes-local.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com\/memes\/55\/vZkVRgCGREH78kfVkydJWKDlv4WCtclJwyxnQhRm.jpg","ocr":"AMEN","title":"1602873262000","slug":"1602873262000","tags":[],"tag_list":null,"categories":"No Category"},{"id":27408,"image":"https:\/\/celestialmemes-local.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com\/memes\/56\/yIKSsJR9Tx1ovGxqc8BnrEaxYIb1gziavFcYIdRt.jpg","ocr":null,"title":"Ah yes the sex_2","slug":"ah-yes-the-sex-2","tags":[],"tag_list":null,"categories":"No Category"},{"id":27664,"image":"https:\/\/celestialmemes-local.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com\/memes\/56\/lni3DNyt5KEpKfO3IQAKLbSahojSqRxIlGj1cetO.jpg","ocr":"WHITE ORANGE SMALLER LARGER SPOT - SPOT - WEBBING - \"WEBBING\" - TASTELESS DELICIOUS BLAND WATERMELON ISWEET WATERMELOM \"MALE\" - \"FEMALE\" - GREEN STEM - DRY STEM - ELONGATED - LARGER - GREEN RIPE WATERY SWEET WATERMELON WATERMELON How my dad finds the best melons","title":"Fake news","slug":"fake-news-3","tags":[],"tag_list":null,"categories":"No Category"},{"id":27920,"image":"https:\/\/celestialmemes-local.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com\/memes\/57\/vo2oLiWs81YQ3ceSP2BwEa1q6sUHlui8FOkFdvlj.jpg","ocr":null,"title":"Happy weekend folks","slug":"happy-weekend-folks","tags":[],"tag_list":null,"categories":"No Category"},{"id":28176,"image":"https:\/\/celestialmemes-local.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com\/memes\/57\/sVlRklZ5yjmOEvxdFEs2JWxPXjAoQjEmEaCAGufJ.jpg","ocr":"The Jetsons - more accurate than expected\nHOME OFFICE\nONLINE CLASSES\nTELEMEDICINE\nVIDEOCALL","title":"What do you think","slug":"what-do-you-think-3","tags":[],"tag_list":null,"categories":"No Category"},{"id":28432,"image":"https:\/\/celestialmemes-local.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com\/memes\/58\/9JgJh556bIsuWIJfEs1ZjW1V80eHrftGaPAlcqYa.jpg","ocr":"GETTING OLD GRACEFULLY","title":"Life happens wherever you are whether you make it or not  Uncle Iroh","slug":"life-happens-wherever-you-are-whether-you-make-it-or-not-uncle-iroh","tags":[],"tag_list":null,"categories":"No Category"}],"links":{"first":"http:\/\/localhost\/api\/posts?page=1","last":"http:\/\/localhost\/api\/posts?page=3238","prev":"http:\/\/localhost\/api\/posts?page=222","next":"http:\/\/localhost\/api\/posts?page=224"},"meta":{"current_page":223,"from":2221,"last_page":3238,"links":[{"url":"http:\/\/localhost\/api\/posts?page=222","label":"&laquo; Previous","active":false},{"url":"http:\/\/localhost\/api\/posts?page=1","label":"1","active":false},{"url":"http:\/\/localhost\/api\/posts?page=2","label":"2","active":false},{"url":null,"label":"...","active":false},{"url":"http:\/\/localhost\/api\/posts?page=220","label":"220","active":false},{"url":"http:\/\/localhost\/api\/posts?page=221","label":"221","active":false},{"url":"http:\/\/localhost\/api\/posts?page=222","label":"222","active":false},{"url":"http:\/\/localhost\/api\/posts?page=223","label":"223","active":true},{"url":"http:\/\/localhost\/api\/posts?page=224","label":"224","active":false},{"url":"http:\/\/localhost\/api\/posts?page=225","label":"225","active":false},{"url":"http:\/\/localhost\/api\/posts?page=226","label":"226","active":false},{"url":null,"label":"...","active":false},{"url":"http:\/\/localhost\/api\/posts?page=3237","label":"3237","active":false},{"url":"http:\/\/localhost\/api\/posts?page=3238","label":"3238","active":false},{"url":"http:\/\/localhost\/api\/posts?page=224","label":"Next &raquo;","active":false}],"path":"http:\/\/localhost\/api\/posts","per_page":10,"to":2230,"total":32380}}
