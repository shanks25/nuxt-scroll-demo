Iwasa bit perplexed - it did not seem to me that it would make any difference whether we waited or not. There aren't any cars. Why do we need to wait Haruki smiled then asked me a question in return What if a child is watching Now I know what they mean when they say it takes a village to raise a child.","title":"IMG_2920","slug":"img-2920","tags":[],"tag_list":null,"categories":"No Category"},{"id":25876,"image":"https:\/\/celestialmemes-local.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com\/memes\/53\/SsRUaiDdFNBeSvaJabzyOou5gN2T3WWhMIKJMJIl.jpg","ocr":null,"title":"20 years ago Neo chose the red pill and were glad he did Happy 20th anniversary The Matrix","slug":"20-years-ago-neo-chose-the-red-pill-and-were-glad-he-did-happy-20th-anniversary-the-matrix","tags":[],"tag_list":null,"categories":"No Category"},{"id":26132,"image":"https:\/\/celestialmemes-local.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com\/memes\/53\/EKQphsQtQjhSyvwghwuafrkbZaZ6kkoRPrvS01Iu.jpg","ocr":"Can you be a normal person and just lick your finger when turning a page!","title":"Coz Normal is Blah","slug":"coz-normal-is-blah","tags":[],"tag_list":null,"categories":"No Category"},{"id":26388,"image":"https:\/\/celestialmemes-local.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com\/memes\/54\/xlEmmyobVQXpaSGk0DnsUtf4zZdlqdMrgGn8LQ2m.jpg","ocr":null,"title":"1591468901000","slug":"1591468901000","tags":[],"tag_list":null,"categories":"No Category"},{"id":26644,"image":"https:\/\/celestialmemes-local.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com\/memes\/54\/96dZMjqjkqToT5rEIrpwif3jfditunoNtcUojjKG.jpg","ocr":"Happy women's day.
