An ordinal decade in the Anno Dominill year numbering system is a period from a year which ends on the digit 1 to the following year which is a multiple of ten for example the period from 1961 to 1970 was the 7th decade of the 20th century (or the 197th decade) and the period from 2001 to 2010 was the 1st decade of the 21st century (or the 201st decade). \"5 Particularly in the 20th century a nominal decade is often used to refer not just to a set of ten years but rather to a period of about ten years  for example the phrase the sixties often refers to events that took place between around 1964 and 1972 and to memories of the counterculture flower power protests of 1968 and other things happening at the time. Often such a nominal decade will come to be known by a title such as the \"Swinging Sixties\" (1960s) the \"Warring Forties\" (1940s) and the \"Roaring Twenties\" (1920s). This practice is occasionally also applied to decades of earlier centuries for example references to the 1890s as the \"Gay Nineties\" or \"Naughty Nineties\". There is currently an ongoing argument whether the \"new decade\" will begin on January 1 2020 or January 1 2021. According to the Gregorian calendar the 203rd decade will begin on January 1 2021 as the first year was the year 1 not zero. However in the commonly-used form of decades they are immune from the no-year-zero argument because of their titles and thus the 2020s will begin on January 1 2020. The correct answer lies on which decade is being referred to. disputed  discuss","title":"1576296950000","slug":"1576296950000","tags":[],"tag_list":null,"categories":"No Category"}],"links":{"first":"http:\/\/localhost\/api\/posts?page=1","last":"http:\/\/localhost\/api\/posts?page=3238","prev":"http:\/\/localhost\/api\/posts?page=326","next":"http:\/\/localhost\/api\/posts?page=328"},"meta":{"current_page":327,"from":3261,"last_page":3238,"links":[{"url":"http:\/\/localhost\/api\/posts?page=326","label":"&laquo; Previous","active":false},{"url":"http:\/\/localhost\/api\/posts?page=1","label":"1","active":false},{"url":"http:\/\/localhost\/api\/posts?page=2","label":"2","active":false},{"url":null,"label":"...","active":false},{"url":"http:\/\/localhost\/api\/posts?page=324","label":"324","active":false},{"url":"http:\/\/localhost\/api\/posts?page=325","label":"325","active":false},{"url":"http:\/\/localhost\/api\/posts?page=326","label":"326","active":false},{"url":"http:\/\/localhost\/api\/posts?page=327","label":"327","active":true},{"url":"http:\/\/localhost\/api\/posts?page=328","label":"328","active":false},{"url":"http:\/\/localhost\/api\/posts?page=329","label":"329","active":false},{"url":"http:\/\/localhost\/api\/posts?page=330","label":"330","active":false},{"url":null,"label":"...","active":false},{"url":"http:\/\/localhost\/api\/posts?page=3237","label":"3237","active":false},{"url":"http:\/\/localhost\/api\/posts?page=3238","label":"3238","active":false},{"url":"http:\/\/localhost\/api\/posts?page=328","label":"Next &raquo;","active":false}],"path":"http:\/\/localhost\/api\/posts","per_page":10,"to":3270,"total":32380}}
