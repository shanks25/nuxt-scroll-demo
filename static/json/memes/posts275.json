They have one of the smallest brain to body ratios of any mammal additionally - their brains are smooth. A brain is folded to increase the surface area for neurons. If you present a koala with leaves plucked from a branch laid on a flat surface the koala will not recognise it as food. They are too thick to adapt their feeding behaviour to cope with change. In a room full of potential food they can literally starve to death. This is not the token of an animal that is winning at life. Speaking of stupidity and food one of the likely reasons for their LM aa tandem e)e-T ate Smal teCel marl additionally to being poisonous eucalyptus leaves (the only thing they eat) have almost no nutritional value. They can't afford the extra energy to think they sleep more than 80% of their fucking lives. When they are awake all they do is eat shit and occasionally scream like fucking satan. Reply 198 +2 emlkr ) Today 345 AM (@emkr Because eucalyptus leaves hold such little nutritional value koalas have to ferment the leaves in their guts for days on end. Unlike their brains they have the largest hind gut to body ratio of any mammal. Many herbivorous mammals have adaptations to cope with harsh plant life taking its toll on their teeth rodents for instance have teeth that never stop growing some animals only have teeth on their lower jaw grinding plant matter on bony plates in the tops of their mouths others have enlarged molars that distribute the wear and break down plant matter more efficiently... Koalas are no exception when their teeth erode down to nothing they resolve the situation by starving to death because they're fucking terrible animals. Being mammals koalas raise their joeys on milk (admittedly one of the lowest milk yields to body ratio... There's a trend here). Reply  55 a emlkr Mj Today 346 AM @emilkr When the young joey needs to transition from rich nourishing substances like milk to eucalyptus (a plant that seems to be making it abundantly clear that it doesn't want to be eaten) it finds it does not have the necessary gut flora to digest the leaves. To remedy this the young joey begins nuzzling its mother's anus until she leaks a little diarrhoea (actually fecal pap slightly less digested) which he then proceeds to slurp on. This partially digested plant matter gives him just what he needs to start developing his digestive system. Of course he may not even have needed to bother nuzzling hi","title":"1616788428000","slug":"1616788428000","tags":[],"tag_list":null,"categories":"No Category"},{"id":30740,"image":"https:\/\/celestialmemes-local.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com\/memes\/62\/MVoqSaSn3ig5T9aA2QrfhJwEsQJ6RWcrOQoqtcTd.jpg","ocr":"Them What do you do for a living Me \"My best I do my best.","title":"Always did","slug":"always-did","tags":[],"tag_list":null,"categories":"No Category"},{"id":30996,"image":"https:\/\/celestialmemes-local.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com\/memes\/63\/8BHlZx7Kd3eOk7XkqG1ybFpsrKKxqxLPXkR7yUhl.jpg","ocr":"Millennials are causing a \"baby bustthey aren't having enough kids to keep the U.S. population at the replacement level America isin a baby bust driven by millennials who are having kids at record tow rates","title":"But WHY arent Millennials having babies","slug":"but-why-arent-millennials-having-babies","tags":[],"tag_list":null,"categories":"No Category"},{"id":31252,"image":"https:\/\/celestialmemes-local.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com\/memes\/63\/EsNVmN2xFkZk1cLE0UKb3HA8aMP6MPbL2IGZBOHa.jpg","ocr":"Tihelwizalral Wwhtolspemt ace 5 The Sos","title":"Every damn time","slug":"every-damn-time-9","tags":[],"tag_list":null,"categories":"No Category"},{"id":31508,"image":"https:\/\/celestialmemes-local.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com\/memes\/64\/MFfbUQwh5bOyBEPtUzqWZOKbxxvevYSVlMEXZGYU.jpg","ocr":"How ur dick get hard after one kiss VY OV 2283 likes mckenton A kissssssss A fuckin kissss Bitch I love you and my dick love you too tf You touch my arm and my dick get hard.
