Places like rest stops stairwells trains parking lots waiting rooms airports feel weird when you're in them because their existence is not about themselves but the things before and after them. They have no definitive place outside of their relationship to the spaces you are coming from and going to. Reality feels altered here because we're not really supposed to be in them for a long time for think about them as their own entities and when we do they seem odd and out of place. The other spaces fee weird because our brains are hard-wired for context - we like things to belong to a certain place and time and when we experience those things outside of the context our brains have developed for them our brains are like NOPE SHIT THIS ISNT RIGHT GET OUT ABORT ABORT. Schools not in session empty museums being awake when other people are asleep - all these things and spaces feel weird because our brain is like \"I already have a context for this space and this is not it so it must be dangerous. Our rational understanding can sometimes override that immediate danger impulse but we're still left with a feeling of wariness and unease. Listen I am very passionate about liminal spaces they are fascinating stuff or perhaps I am merely a nerd. BB erriccooo I for one appreciate your passion for liminal spaces and thank you for explaining it to the rest of us.","title":"Oh so thats what theyre called","slug":"oh-so-thats-what-theyre-called","tags":[],"tag_list":null,"categories":"No Category"},{"id":8469,"image":"https:\/\/celestialmemes-local.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com\/memes\/18\/9wvQ4IWeqDSAW8cbvAHe9gGr3K0TZ92ggBYSTOaI.jpg","ocr":"","title":"Starter Homes 2019","slug":"starter-homes-2019","tags":[],"tag_list":null,"categories":"No Category"},{"id":8725,"image":"https:\/\/celestialmemes-local.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com\/memes\/18\/uUT81DBXgTbEsrL3PZ9iFwoD6qyicIRvNvb5z5Nv.jpg","ocr":"","title":"The Egyptians were the first memers","slug":"the-egyptians-were-the-first-memers","tags":[],"tag_list":null,"categories":"No Category"},{"id":8981,"image":"https:\/\/celestialmemes-local.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com\/memes\/19\/CiMBH88E9OuhOvLePXErfmtu1W0V3VgYe3efjfjd.jpg","ocr":"I MUERTE h oe","title":"This is me_2","slug":"this-is-me-2","tags":[],"tag_list":null,"categories":"No Category"},{"id":9237,"image":"https:\/\/celestialmemes-local.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com\/memes\/19\/orWTTQPU2j7SWvWzqBhqMk7AqBmdtOzvlTB9plyK.jpg","ocr":"WHEN YOU CUM Bt Sy IT SPELLS OUT WHAT YOUR a aad","title":"Unlucky young hia5vf8fd","slug":"unlucky-young-hia5vf8fd","tags":[],"tag_list":null,"categories":"No Category"},{"id":9493,"image":"https:\/\/celestialmemes-local.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com\/memes\/20\/hsFjrv77CeSnwVH0SdkxDH73cOyV3heEZ2MyQWF9.jpg","ocr":"Me-People died in summer because of high temperatures God-Yes Me-People died in monsoon because of floods and heavy rain fall God-Yes Me-What are you planning for the winter God-Yes","title":"What the hell are you planning","slug":"what-the-hell-are-you-planning","tags":[],"tag_list":null,"categories":"No Category"},{"id":9749,"image":"https:\/\/celestialmemes-local.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com\/memes\/20\/d4Yj16dNIgS0WXC3rsf8dQfQlIZ5frkfhEQyw2ug.jpg","ocr":"","title":"Why is the rum gone","slug":"why-is-the-rum-gone","tags":[],"tag_list":null,"categories":"No Category"},{"id":10005,"image":"https:\/\/celestialmemes-local.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com\/memes\/21\/WAHg6ufmbWCIuEeDEMm2p4Fciqq8TBuf6UDXT8xb.jpg","ocr":"1621 QA ll 61% a www.google.com O iat See... now THIS is a good wall ...
